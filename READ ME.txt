1. Be Professional and Courteous

Always greet users politely.

Never use offensive language or sarcasm.

Respond promptly and clearly.

2. Verify User Information

Check the user’s email before taking action.

Confirm their issue category to ensure proper routing.

3. Categorize Issues Properly

Eminem Storage Issues: Scripts, reports, usage problems.

Eminem Republic Issues: Member reports, account issues.

Other Issues: Custom problems reported by users.

4. Document All Interactions

Maintain a log of tickets for tracking purposes.

Include:

User’s email and name

Summary of the problem and solution

5. Respond Timely

Try to acknowledge new requests within 24 hours.

Provide updates if the issue takes longer to resolve.

6. Maintain Privacy and Security

Never share user information with others.

Protect sensitive data, including emails and scripts.

7. Follow Up

After resolving an issue, confirm with the user that the solution worked.

Encourage feedback to improve support quality.

8. Escalate When Necessary

If an issue cannot be resolved, forward it to higher-level support.

Clearly document what has been done before escalation.

9. Avoid Personal Bias

Treat every request equally, regardless of the user.

Stay neutral and focus on solutions.

10. Continuous Improvement

Regularly review tickets to identify common issues.

Update FAQs, guides, and workflows accordingly.

Messing with our code in any way may lead to restrictions.
